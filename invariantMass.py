"""
The next method was attempted to be used to calculate both the curve_fit and the 
Negative log likelihood of the Curve function. This was to be used to let the 
program guess the most accurate values for my initial parameters and then try to minimise 
the uncertainty. 
I could not get this to work and im not sure why, as several methods were attempted, but no 
method was without python pulling up errors. The 2 commented out lines below were my initial attempts
but would not plot a curve, so i have left the best case scenario in, where an (inaccurate) curve
has been plotted for the PDF
